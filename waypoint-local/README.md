# Run Waypoint server and a single runner locally

Sometimes it's easier to just the process locally for development. These
scripts will start up a local waypoint server and runner for dev.

The shutdown scripts will attempt to stop the server and runner gracefully with
an interrupt signal rather than a kill.
