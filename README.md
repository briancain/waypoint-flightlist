# Waypoint FlightList

A repository that helps users reproduce and triage issues with waypoint and the
various plugins it supports.

Inspired by the sandbox dev environment for [vagrant](https://github.com/briancain/congenial-octo-palm-tree)

## Plan

Integrate example waypoint configs from https://github.com/hashicorp/waypoint-examples
and use this repo to set up the required services to test.

This repo could also include more triage specific waypoint.hcl configs that come
up as we help folks on GitHub and Discuss
